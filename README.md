**This repository is obsolete. Docker images are created by [GitLab CI scripts](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) from a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) that is in the main [sagemath/sage](https://github.com/sagemath/sage) repository now.**

# Containers for SageMath & friends

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles and supporting files
for building various containers for SageMath and its components (GAP,
Singular, PARI/GP, ...).

The containers are available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sagemath/).

## Tag format

Each image is tagged with the version of SageMath installed in that image (e.g.
8.0).

Tags with a version like `X.Y-N` represent revisions to the image itself i.e.
changes that were made to the Dockerfile it was built from.  For example while
`sagemath:8.0` is the first image to contain SageMath 8.0, `sagemath:8.0-1` is
the first revised SageMath 8.0 image.

## [sagemath/sagemath](sagemath/Dockerfile) (roughly 3.6 GB)

This container contains a basic installation of the latest version of
SageMath, built from sources on the latest Ubuntu. Commands are run as
the Sage user. The SageMath distribution includes several programs
like GAP, Singular, PARI/GP, R, ... which are available in the path.

### Installation

    docker pull sagemath/sagemath

or simply continue to the next step.

### Running Sage & co with a console interface

To run Sage:

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath

Other software included in this image can be run similarly:

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath gap

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath gp         # PARI/GP

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath maxima

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath R

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath singular

### Running the notebook interfaces

To run the Jupyter Notebook interface (for Sage, ...):

    docker run -p 8888:8888 sagemath/sagemath-jupyter

Alternatively, to run the legacy Sage notebook server:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 sagemath/sagemath sage -notebook

You can then connect your web browser to the printed out typically, namely
http://localhost:8888 for the Jupyter notebook and http://localhost:8080 for
the legacy notebook. For the legacy notebook the webbrowser will ask for a
login and password which are respectively `admin` and `sage`.

**Note** Running the sagemath-jupyter container is equivalent to running the
`sagemath/sagemath` base docker container with the following command:

    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 sagemath/sagemath sage -notebook=jupyter --no-browser --ip='*' --port=8888

The `--ip` option is required by the Jupyter notebook to allow connections to
the notebook through the Docker network.

### Rebuilding the container

Prequisites: network access to download Sage (http/https)

    docker build --tag="sagemath/sagemath" sagemath

## [sagemath/sagemath-develop](sagemath-develop/Dockerfile)

This container is similar to the previous one, except that SageMath is built
from the latest unstable release version of Sage, retrieved by cloning the
develop branch from github.

TODO: include git-trac

To download and start it:

    docker run -it sagemath/sagemath-develop

### Rebuilding the container

    docker build --tag="sagemath/sagemath-develop" sagemath-develop

## [sagemath/sagemath-jupyter](sagemath-jupyter/Dockerfile)

If you want to have a container already set up for the Jupyter enviroment,
you can use sagemath/sagemath-jupyter. It is based on sagemath/sagemath.

    docker run -p 8888:8888 sagemath/sagemath-jupyter

makes the Jupyter notebook accessible via `localhost:8888`, while

    docker run sagemath/sagemath-jupyter

makes it accessible under the container's ip address on port `8888`. You can
see the ip address of the container using `docker inspect`. This is useful if
you want to have more than one notebook server running.  Typically this will
be something like:

    172.17.0.1

where the fourth field may be incremented depending on the number of running
containers on the host.

### Rebuilding the container

    docker build --tag="sagemath/sagemath-jupyter" sagemath-jupyter

## [sagemath/sagemath-patchbot](sagemath-patchbot/Dockerfile)

This container, built on top of sagemath-develop, is meant to run
instances of the [Sage patchbot](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/)
running securely in a sandbox, to ensure that the untrusted code it
fetches and run cannot harm the host machine.

### Starting the patchbot:

    docker run -t --name="patchbot" -d sagemath/sagemath-patchbot
    pid=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' patchbot )
    ip=$(docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' patchbot )
    trac_ip=$(getent hosts trac.sagemath.org | awk '{ print $1 }')
    patchbot_ip=$(getent hosts patchbot.sagemath.org | awk '{ print $1 }')
    nsenter -t $pid -n iptables -A FORWARD -s ${ip} -d ${trac_ip} -j ACCEPT
    nsenter -t $pid -n iptables -A FORWARD -s ${ip} -d ${patchbot_ip} -j ACCEPT
    nsenter -t $pid -n iptables -A FORWARD -s ${ip} -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

    while true; docker run --tty=true --rm=true sagemath/sagemath-patchbot; done

### Rebuilding the container:

    docker build --tag="sagemath/sagemath-patchbot" sagemath-patchbot

## sagemath/sagemath-fat (planned)

sagemath/sagemath with latex, the commonly used (GAP) packages, etc.

## sagemath/sagemath-fat-jupyter (planned)

Same as sagemath-jupyter, but based on sagemath-fat
